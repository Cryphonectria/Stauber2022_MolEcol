# Stauber et al. 2022, Molecular Ecology - analysis pipeline

```01_SNPassociations```: Analysis mating type and vic loci associated SNPs

```02_popstructure```: Analysis of population structure - DAPC, AMOVA and PCA 

```03_diversity_stats```: 
* Make summary statistics (number of SNPs, percent singletons, SNP density, nucleotide diversity)
* calculate and plot allele frequencies and minor allele frequency (MAF) spectra of high, moderate and modifier impact mutations
